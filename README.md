**Notice:** This is a proof of concept for utilizing Blockchain as a service for end-to-end traceability. However, it can be built to integrate total supply chain components into it.

- Contracts provide end-to-end bloackchain solutions to help businesses enhance transparency, efficiency, and innovation across complex ecosystems. 
- It utilizes the power of smart contracts and a web framework for seamless product traceability.

## End-to-End Traceability

The Contrackts Proof of Concept (PoC) automates complex, multi-step workflows across any business via seamless integration and smart contracts. Built-in self-executing triggers initiate appropriate actions across your network in real-time based on activity. Smart contracts encode rules to connect events to responses.
